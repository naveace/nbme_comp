This is the project directory where all of our main development is going to happen. It is effectively empty right now. I have found that a good project layout is:

```
project/
├─ experiments/
├─ data/
├─ analysis/
├─ README.md
```
But we will find a good one together as our project develops. 
Above all else, remember good SWE principles; type objects wherever possible and give reasonable docstrings. It will make life a lot easier

Jupyter notebooks are usually the best place to free-form experiment, but when something is mature enough to go into a helper function, please make it usable for everyone else :)
